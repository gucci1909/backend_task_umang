# What is WebSockets?

> WebSockets are basically use for faster responses from the server to the client .It makes an API establishing with "socket" connections between a web browser and a server. It enables persistent connection between the client and the server and both parties can start sending data at any time. When you chat with someone , you are sending sending a request to the server and for smooth and faster request sending webSockets are use . Another simple example for webSockets would be share market price update on your phone , the share market price usually change alot and updating every value and putting to the database may take a certain amount of time every time , that's why websockets can be used for updating the value faster and in a smooth way. WebSockets also give client great and faster experience of the website.

> I made the backend with my own configuration of redis and mongodb. You can locally run the backend and can also follow the localhost link - http://localhost:8080 , where you will see the functionality running of a Todo app and also whatever you are adding there , will be saved to my redis cache data and if the cache data length becomes more than 50 , the data will be saved to my mongodb atlas and the cache will be flush out. Todo List which you will see in the frontend is coming from the /fetchAllTasks route.
